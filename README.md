maven-cujojs-seed
=================

A Maven/Eclipse setup for working with JavaScript.

## Description
This is an example project layout for working with eclipse, maven and javascript. One of the main goals of this project is to use JavaScript as normal Maven dependencies without copying or unpacking source files. This example uses the cujojs seed project as a template.

## Prerequisites
* eclipse version >= 4.2.1
* m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse >= 1.3.0
* m2e-wtp - Maven Integration for WTP >= 0.17.0

In otherwords use Eclipse Juno SR2

## Comming Soon...
* Integration of Jasmine + PhantomJS for development and build time unit-testing
* Integration of GEB (WebDriver) for automated browser-testing
* Link to cujojs libs rather than checkin.
